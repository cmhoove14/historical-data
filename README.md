# historical-data
Longitudinal data of COVID-19 infections and deaths in U.S. prisons. This does not include Federal Prisons or jails. 

## Florida Notes
- Population data from [HIFLD](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/prison-boundaries/data), note that it is NOT up-to-date
- Removed two observations of "GEO" prison that had no data associated with them.
